// In JavaScript, Promises are used for handling asynchronous operations. They provide a way to work with asynchronous code in a more manageable and readable manner compared to traditional callback functions.

// What is a Promise?
// A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

// A Promise can be in one of three states:

// Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
// Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
// Rejected: The operation failed.
